title: Category permissions and shared catalogs
---

If category permissions are enabled in {{site.data.var.ee}}, or if shared catalogs are enabled in {{site.data.var.b2b}}, then Magento can be configured to restrict who can perform the following actions:

*  View the contents of categories
*  View product prices
*  Add products to a cart
*  Search the catalog

{{site.data.var.ee}} restricts these actions based on customer group.
